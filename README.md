# Complaint-Management-System
Corruption is one of the biggest problems our country is facing. Even the police department is not free from it. According to a survey (in references) 24% of people were unable to register complaints and 9% of them reported being demanded bribes just to register a complaint. Many people refrain from filing complaints against influential individuals due to fear of the consequences, which further promotes crime in the country.

Our aim is to propose a blockchain-based solution to manage complaints filed by civilians. This solution will ensure both transparency (to prevent unaddressed complaints) and the hidden identity of the complainant (to encourage reporting without fear).
